15.1-1

Show that equation (15.4) follows from equation (15.3) and the initial condition
T(0) = 1.

Solution:

Shown in Bluebook.


15.1-2

Show, by means of a counterexample, that the following “greedy” strategy does
not always determine an optimal way to cut rods. Define the density of a rod of
length i to be pi/i, that is, its value per inch. The greedy strategy for a rod of
length n cuts off a first piece of length i, where 1 <= i <= n, having maximum
density. It then continues by applying the greedy strategy to the remaining piece of
length n - i.

Solution:

Shown in Bluebook.
