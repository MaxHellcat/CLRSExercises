22.4-2

Give a linear-time algorithm that takes as input a directed acyclic graph G =
(V,E) and two vertices s and t, and returns the number of simple paths from s
to t in G. For example, the directed acyclic graph of Figure 22.8 contains exactly
four simple paths from vertex p to vertex v: pov, poryv, posryv, and psryv.
(Your algorithm needs only to count the simple paths, not list them.)
