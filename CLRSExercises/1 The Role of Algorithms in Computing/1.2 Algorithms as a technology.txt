1.2-1

Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application
level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

Solution:

Text/Audio/Video editors (formatting, filters), video games (shortest path, shaders).


1.2-2

Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the
same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n^2 steps, while merge
sort runs in 64nlgn steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge
sort?

Solution:

We have an equation 8n*n = 8n*8*lgn =>
n = 8*lgn, which has roots n1 = 1.1, n2 = 43.559.

Thus for input of size 1 <= n <= 43 insertion sort beats merge sort, and for n >= 44 merge sort starts to beat insertion sort.


1.2-3

What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n^2
runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^n on the same machine?

Solution:

The equation 100n^2 = 2^n has roots n1 = -0.1, n2 = 0.1, and n3 = 14.32.

Thus for n >= 15 the 100n^2 algorithm runs faster.
