23.1-1

Let (u,v) be a minimum-weight edge in a connected graph G. Show that (u,v)
belongs to some minimum spanning tree of G.

Solution:

Let's cut G so that edge (u,v) crosses the cut. Since (u,v) is a minimum-weight
edge in G, then it's a light edge crossing the cut, hence it belongs
to some minimum spanning tree of G.

23.1-2

Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem 23.1. Let G =
(V,E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined
on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning
tree for G, let (S, V-S) be any cut of G that respects A, and let (u,v) be a safe
edge for A crossing (S, V-S). Then, (u,v) is a light edge for the cut. Show that
the professorâ€™s conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample.

Solution:

A counterexample is easily seen on Figure 23.2. On initially empty A, let's make
a cut with the following edges crossing it (c,d), (c,f), and (g,f). As we can see,
edges (c,d) and (c,f) are safe edges for A, but they're not the minimum-weight edges
for A.
