25.3-1

Use Johnsonâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in
the graph of Figure 25.2. Show the values of h and w^ computed by the algorithm.

Solution:

TODO: Draw in Bluebook.


25.3-2

What is the purpose of adding the new vertex s to V, yielding V'?

Solution:

To compute h(v) (shortest distance) for each vertex in G, which is used to reweight
edges for the Dijkstra algorithm, which is used to compute the resulting matrix of
all-pairs shortest paths.
