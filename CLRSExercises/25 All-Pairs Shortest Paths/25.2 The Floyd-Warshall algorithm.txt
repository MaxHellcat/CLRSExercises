25.2-1

Run the Floyd-Warshall algorithm on the weighted, directed graph of Figure 25.2.
Show the matrix D(k) that results for each iteration of the outer loop.

Solution:

Carefully drawn in Bluebook.


25.2-6

How can we use the output of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to detect the presence
of a negative-weight cycle?

Solution:

At least value in main diagonal is < 0.

TODO: Test this claim.
