32.2-1

Working modulo q = 11, how many spurious hits does the Rabin-Karp matcher encounter
in the text T = 3141592653589793 when looking for the pattern P = 26?

Solution:
Assuming each character is a decimal digit, as this section states.

p = 26 % 11 = 4

Overall
3141592653589793 -> T
938444499231925 -> t0...t(n-m)
There're 4 hits for t3=15, t4=59, t5=92, and t6=26 respectively, where the first 3 are spurious.
