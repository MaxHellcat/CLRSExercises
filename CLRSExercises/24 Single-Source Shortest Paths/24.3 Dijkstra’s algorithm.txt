24.3-1

Run Dijkstra’s algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 24.2, first using vertex s
as the source and then using vertex z as the source. In the style of Figure 24.6,
show the d and & values and the vertices in set S after each iteration of the while
loop.

Solution:

Drawn in Bluebook.


24.3-2

Give a simple example of a directed graph with negative-weight edges for which
Dijkstra’s algorithm produces incorrect answers. Why doesn’t the proof of Theorem
24.6 go through when negative-weight edges are allowed?

Solution:
