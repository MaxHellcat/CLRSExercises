24.1-1

Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 24.4, using vertex
z as the source. In each pass, relax edges in the same order as in the figure, and
show the d and p values after each pass. Now, change the weight of edge (z,x)
to 4 and run the algorithm again, using s as the source.

Solution:

Drawn in Bluebook.


24.1-2

Prove Corollary 24.3.

For reference Corollary 24.3
Let G = .(V,E) be a weighted, directed graph with source vertex s and weight
function w: E -> R, and assume that G contains no negative-weight cycles that
are reachable from s. Then, for each vertex v in V, there is a path from s to v if
and only if BELLMAN-FORD terminates with v.d < +INF when it is run on G.

Solution:

By Lemma 24.2 when BELLMAN-FORD terminates, we have v.d = sigma(s,v) for all v reachable
from s. This value v.d < +INF, since we apply the triangle-inequality
sigma(s,v) <= sigma(s,u) + w(u,v) for each v, where s.d = 0 and all edges have finite weights.
All unreachable vertices v' have v'.d = +INF, due to INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE.
