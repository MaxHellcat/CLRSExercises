24.5-1

Give two shortest-paths trees for the directed graph of Figure 24.2 (on page 648)
other than the two shown.

Solution:

Drawn in Bluebook.


24.5-3

Embellish the proof of Lemma 24.10 to handle cases in which shortest-path
weights are +INF or -INF.

Solution:

If sigma(s,u) = +INF (u is unreachable from s), then also sigma(s,v) = +INF.
Since w(u,v) is finite, we have:
+INF = +INF + w(u,v), which satisifies sigma(s,v) <= sigma(s,u) + w(u,v)

Case with -INF is proved similarly.
