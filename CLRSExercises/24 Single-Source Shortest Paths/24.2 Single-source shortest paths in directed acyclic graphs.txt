24.2-1

Run DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS on the directed graph of Figure 24.5, using vertex r
as the source.

Solution:

Drawn in Bluebook.


24.2-2

Suppose we change line 3 of DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS to read

3   for the first |V| - 1 vertices, taken in topologically sorted order

Show that the procedure would remain correct.

Solution:

When vertices in a directed graph are topologically sorted, if there's an edge (u,v) then
u appears before v in the ordering. The last vertex therefore has empty adjacency list
and so RELAX step on line 5 will not be called, proving that procedure would remain correct.
