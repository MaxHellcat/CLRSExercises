Prove that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-choice property.

Solution:

Let the greedy choice to be choosing the item with the maximum value per pound.
We claim that applying it to a sub-problem yields an optimal solution to the problem, since
we always fill the knapsack to its capacity.
Indeed, if there exists other item with more value per pound, then we'd choose it
to be the greedy choice, rendering our claim invalid. Thus our claim is correct.
