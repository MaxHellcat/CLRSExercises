21.1-1

Suppose that CONNECTED-COMPONENTS is run on the undirected graph G D .V;E/, where V D fa; b; c; d; e; f; g; h; i; j; kg and the edges of E are processed
in the order .d; i /; .f; k/; .g; i /; .b; g/; .a; h/; .i; j /; .d; k/; .b; j /; .d; f /;
.g; j /; .a; e/. List the vertices in each connected component after each iteration of
lines 3â€“5.

21.1-2

Show that after all edges are processed by CONNECTED-COMPONENTS, two vertices
are in the same connected component if and only if they are in the same set.

Solution:

When edge u,v is processed in line 5, both u and v become members of one set.
When all edges are processed, we have disjoint sets of connected vertices. Each pair
of vertices here are reachable from each other and thus belong to the same connected
component.
