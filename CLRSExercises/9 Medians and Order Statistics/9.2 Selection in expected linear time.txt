9.2-1

Show that RANDOMIZED-SELECT never makes a recursive call to a 0-length array.

Solution:
It never makes if passed i in RANDOMIZED-SELECT(A, p, r, i) is in range [1..A.size],
otherwise it will. Tested with the code in Algo.


9.2-2

Argue that the indicator random variable Xk and the value T(max(k-1, n-k))
are independent.

Solution:
TBD


9.2-3

Write an iterative version of RANDOMIZED-SELECT.

Solution:

Coded in Algo. Find by 9.2-3


9.2-4
Suppose we use RANDOMIZED-SELECT to select the minimum element of the
array A = (3, 2, 9, 0, 7, 5, 4, 8, 6, 1). Describe a sequence of partitions that results
in a worst-case performance of RANDOMIZED-SELECT.

Solution:

The RANDOMIZED-SELECT must be unlucky enough to pick pivots in decreasing order, e.g.
for the array A that would be 9, 8, 7, ..., 0
