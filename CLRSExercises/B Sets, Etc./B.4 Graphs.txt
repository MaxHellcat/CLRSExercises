B.4-1

Attendees of a faculty party shake hands to greet each other, and each professor
remembers how many times he or she shook hands. At the end of the party, the
department head adds up the number of times that each professor shook hands.
Show that the result is even by proving the handshaking lemma: if G = (V, E) is
an undirected graph, then
(v = V)SUM(degree(v)) = 2|E|

Solution:

Since handshake is a mutual process, let's assume the graph G is undirected.
Then each vertex has degree(v) = |V| - 1, as each professor greets all others.

We have a summation:
[v=1..V]SUM(degree(v)) = [v=1..V]SUM(|V| - 1) = |V| * (|V| - 1)

To show that |V| * (|V| - 1) = 2|E|, let's take an undirected graph G with |V| = 4, which
has |E| = 6 by visual observation.

Solving the expression we have:
|V| * (|V| - 1) = 4 * 3 = 12 = 2|E|


B.4-2

Show that if a directed or undirected graph contains a path between two vertices u
and v, then it contains a simple path between u and v. Show that if a directed graph
contains a cycle, then it contains a simple cycle.

Solution:

Looking at the figure B.2a, consider path 2-4-5-4-1. The subpath 4-5-4 is in fact a two-edge cycle, and vertices 4 and 5 can be "contracted" into a single vertex, producing the simple path 2-4-1.
The same applies to a cycle, which is a path where v0 = vk.


B.4-3

Show that any connected, undirected graph G = (V, E) satisfies |E| >= |V| - 1.

Solution:

To connect two vertices we need just one edge, so 1 >= 2 - 1 - holds.

In general, to connect |V| vertices we need at least |V| - 1 edges plus edges to
optionally connect vertices between each other.


B.4-4

Verify that in an undirected graph, the “is reachable from” relation is an equivalence
relation on the vertices of the graph. Which of the three properties of an
equivalence relation hold in general for the “is reachable from” relation on the
vertices of a directed graph?

Solution:

Let R be the binary relation on V, then it's an equivalence relation if:
R = reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Vertex v is reachable from itself via 0-length path, so reflexive.
If vertex vi is reachable from vj, then vj reachable from vi, as graph is undirected, so symmetric.
If vi R vj and vj R vk, then vi R vk (path vi, vj, vk), so transitive.
Thus we've shown that R is equivalence relation on V of the graph G.

For a directed graph:
Reflexivity holds, as vertex v is always reachable from itself via 0-length path.
Symmetry doesn't hold, as the fact that vi is reachable from vj, doesn't mean the opposite for a directed graph.
Transitivity holds, as described for an undirected graph.


B.4-5

What is the undirected version of the directed graph in Figure B.2(a)? What is the
directed version of the undirected graph in Figure B.2(b)?

Solution:

a. Trivially converted using the rule: The undirected version contains the edges of G “with their directions removed” and with self-loops eliminated.

b. For the directed version, we replace each undirected edge (u, v) in G by the two directed edges (u, v) and (v, u).
