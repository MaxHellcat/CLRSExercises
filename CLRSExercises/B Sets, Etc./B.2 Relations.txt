B.2-1

Prove that the subset relation “≤” on all subsets of Z is a partial order but not atotal order.

Solution:

Note: Here “≤” will mean “a subset of” (haven't found that symbol).

Z - set of integers, infinite, countable.

Let R be a relation on Z, then from the basic properties of sets, it is:

Reflexive, as a ≤ a, for a = {0, …, 10}
Antisymmetric, as a ≤ b and b ≤ a imply a = b, for a = {0, …, 10}, b = {0, …, 10}
Transitive, as a ≤ b and b ≤ c imply a ≤ c, for a = {0, …, 10}, b = {0, …, 30}, c = {0, …, 50},

thus R is a partial order.

It’s not a total order, however, since not any two subsets are related by the R, e.g.
{0, …, 10} and {20, …, 30}, or {10, …, 30} and {20, …, 50}


B.2-2

Show that for any positive integer n, the relation “equivalent modulo n” is an equivalencerelation on the integers. (We say that a = b (mod n) if there exists aninteger q such that a - b = qn.) Into what equivalence classes does this relationpartition the integers?

Solution:

P = {1, 2, 3, …}

{1, 2, 3, …} x {1, 2, 3, …} = {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, …}

Let R be a relation on P, such that for (a, b) belonging to P a is “equivalent module n” to b.

Note: When a is “equivalent module n” to b, then both have the same remainder, when divided by n.

Reflexive, as 5 R 5 (obvious)
Symmetric, as 11 R 31 (mod 10) implies 31 R 11 (mod 10) (obvious)
Transitive, as 3 R 9 (mod 3) and 9 R 27 (mod 3) imply 3 R 27 (mod 3),

thus R is an equivalence relation.

But, these are NOT equivalence classes, since sets are not disjoint:
[1] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …} (mod 1)
[2] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 …} (mod 2)
[3] = {3, 6, 9, 12, …} (mod 3)
[4] = {4, 8, 12}

So think more here!


B.2-3

Give examples of relations that area. reflexive and symmetric but not transitive,b. reflexive and transitive but not symmetric,c. symmetric and transitive but not reflexive.

Solution:

a. Reflexive and symmetric but not transitive:
Friends (mutual) (provided a person is a friend to himself)

b. Reflexive and transitive but not symmetric:
≤, ≥

c. Symmetric and transitive but not reflexive:
Ability of a person to carry other person =)


B.2-4

Let S be a finite set, and let R be an equivalence relation on S x S. Show that ifin addition R is antisymmetric, then the equivalence classes of S with respect to Rare singletons.

Solution:

R:
a R a
a R b => b R a
a R b and b R c => a R c
In addition:
a R b and b R a => a = b

By definition, the equivalence class of a is the set of all elements equivalent to a, or formally:
[a] = {b: a R b}

Since R is antisymmetric, then b = a, therefore [a] = {a} and thus is a singleton.


B.2-5

Professor Narcissus claims that if a relation R is symmetric and transitive, then it isalso reflexive. He offers the following proof. By symmetry, a R b implies b R a.Transitivity, therefore, implies a R a. Is the professor correct?

Solution:

The professor seems to be correct, as a R b and b R a => a R a is a special case of transitivity a R b and b R c => a R c, when a = c.

TODO: How then did you come up with the answer on B.2-3 item c?

Old:
Transitivity states that a R b and b R c imply a R c, that is it holds for a, b, c that in general are all different. Therefore professor Narcissus is wrong, since his proof covers only a specific case of transitivity, when c = a.
