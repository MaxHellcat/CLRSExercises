B.3-1

Let A and B be finite sets, and let f : A -> B be a function. Show that

a. if f is injective, then |A| <= |B|;
b. if f is surjective, then |A| >= |B|.


Solution:

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

If f is injective, then each distinct element of domain A is mapped to a distinct element of codomain B. Thus B should be at least of size of domain A, or |A| <= |B|.

TODO: What are the elements in B that aren't images of elements in A?

When f in surjective, distinct elements of A can map to the same element of B. Thus A is at least the size of B, or |A| >= |B|.


B.3-2

Is the function f(x) = x + 1 bijective when the domain and the codomain are N?Is it bijective when the domain and the codomain are Z?

Solution:

For N:
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
2 + 1 = 3

Whereas f(x) is injective (distinct x maps to distinct f(x)), it isn't surjective, since its value > 0, whereas 0 belongs to N. Alternatively, its codomain N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} isn't its range {1, 2, 3, ...}.
Thus f(x) isn't bijective for N.

For Z:
-4 + 1 = -3
-3 + 1 = -2
-2 + 1 = -1
-1 + 1 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
2 + 1 = 3
3 + 1 = 4

Here f(x) is also injective. But now it's also surjective, since its codomain is equal to its range, as seen from the example above. Thus for Z the f(x) is bijective.


B.3-3

Give a natural definition for the inverse of a binary relation such that if a relationis in fact a bijective function, its relational inverse is its functional inverse.

Solution:

Hmm =)
