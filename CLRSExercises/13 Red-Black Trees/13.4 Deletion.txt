13.4-1

Argue that after executing RB-DELETE-FIXUP, the root of the tree must be black.

Solution:

Loop terminates in two cases, either x is root or x has red color. If x is root,
then it's colored black in line 23. If x not root, then root has the same color it had
before calling RB-DELETE-FIXUP, which is black.
